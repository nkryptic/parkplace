# Amazon's own S3 service contains a big list of its error codes 
# at http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/2006-03-01/ErrorCodeList.html.
# Park Place builds exception classes for each of these error codes.
# Then, when one of these exceptions is thrown, it is displayed as XML
# in the ParkPlace#service method.
