  Okay, so, you've checked out from Subversion and you want to get this suckr
  up and everything.

  First, a checklist:

    1. Do you have Camping and Mongrel installed?

         gem install camping mongrel --include-dependencies

    2. I would also recommend the `sendfile' gem if you're on non-Windows.

         gem install sendfile

    3. Do you have SQLite3 installed?  (If you don't want to mess with the
       database driver.)

         Follow these instructions EXACTLY AS WRITTEN:

  Okay, time to turn it on:

    bin/parkplace

  Once you're sold, you can go ahead and install it for reals:

    sudo ruby setup.rb
    parkplace
